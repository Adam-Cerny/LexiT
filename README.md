# LexiT: Vocabulary Training App

LexiT is a terminal-based vocabulary training application designed primarily for Linux users, though it is also compatible with Windows and Mac systems through terminal tools. The name "LexiT" cleverly combines "lexicon," referring to the vocabulary of a language, with "terminal," emphasizing its command-line interface.

## Key Features

- **Score Tracking:** LexiT tracks your performance, allowing you to monitor your progress as you practice.
- **Adaptive Learning:** The app prioritizes words that you've struggled with by asking them more frequently. This helps reinforce your memory and improve retention.
- **Randomized Questions:** To keep the learning experience engaging, LexiT presents vocabulary questions in a random order, ensuring a varied practice each time you use it.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** While primarily developed for Linux, LexiT can be run on Windows and Mac, making it accessible to a broader audience.
- **Example Database:** LexiT includes an example database derived from the *Mein Pass schon 4* German workbook, providing a clear guideline on how vocabulary words should be structured and added to the application.
